This project is a work-in-progress. Not all features described below are fully implemented yet.

## Description

Orbitrakr is an antenna rotator controller intended for pointing an antenna at satellites in low earth orbit. The controller consists of an ESP32 microcontroller board and two motor drivers. The motors drive the azimuth and elevation axes of the rotator, to which the antenna is mounted.

This repository contains the controller firmware.

This is the developer documentation for those interested in understanding the source code or contributing to the project. For the end-user documentation, which covers the features of the software and how to use it, please see the [Orbitrakr website](https://mdkendall.github.io/Orbitrakr) on GitHub Pages.
